I took the test and sent the free score reports, but when I saw the score I had dropped in both sections and gotten a 1300. I am mortified that this may have broken my application. They say that highest scores are what is viewed, but now that they have all these scores, including Barnard who is also an All Score school, this later test will probably play against me. I did fairly well on the essay, as it was required by both Brown and Princeton. But those lower SAT scores tho. Its a best.
