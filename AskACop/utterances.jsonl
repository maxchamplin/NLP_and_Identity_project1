I've been to a lawyer for some advice [thanks to a work benefit I got 30 minutes free], but there were a few things I forgot to ask if they were legal, and also wanted the perspective of if/when to go to the police from someone in law enforcement.\n\nThere's a big problem in that trying to get proof of the abuse is difficult, because at this point it is all emotional. So, we are trying to find anything we can that can be brought against her and/or her boyfriend.\n\nThere are 5 people in a 2 bedroom apartment. Four people are on the lease, and legally there are only supposed to be four people living there. Female Abuser is the primary abuser, and Male Abuser is the lesser abuser and mainly her enabler. Female Abuser is not on the lease, but Male Abuser is, as well as myself and the two other tennants.\n\nWe are trying to fix this situation by getting her kicked out, and Male Abuser will probably follow her.\n\nOne of my other roommates had suggested that we take some of their mail, since we know that she is receiving her mail here. But, I was worried about that falling under the federal crime even though we're all in the same place. My question is, is it illegal to take a picture of the unopened envelope or mail left on a table?\n\nWe are having trouble figuring out a way to really prove that she lives here that could not easily be explained away, especially since the apartment complex is required to give 48 hour notice before they visit.\n\nA friend suggested that I try to get my neighbors to help and complain. And with some of the fights she's had with her boyfriend, I've considered calling the cops.\n\nAnd there was a time that she refused to give me my car keys until another roommate stepped in. Had that continued, I would have called the cops.\n\nOne of the things I'm worried about is getting in trouble for her pot. We don't want her here, we can't get our leasing office to do anything, and if we call the cops on them we're afraid of being lumped in with them.\n\nAlso, I live in Pennsylvania, so that answers the question on if we can record anything without their knowledge or not (we can't).\n\nAny insight on how to get our abusers kicked out would be amazing.

So I live in Los Angeles and something happened last night that freaked me out and I'm looking for advice on how to proceed, or if there's anything I should do at all.\n\nI co-rent a practice studio in Hollywood where I go to play music. Last night I was going there to practice and I needed to stop by the ATM to pick up cash so I could give rent money to my roommate. I parked, ran up, took out some money, and ran back to the car since I wasn't sure whether I'd parked legally.\n\nAs I was getting in my car, two uniformed police officers rolled up to me in an unmarked car. I rolled down my window and they told me \"We've been watching you. We know what you've been up to.\" and drove away before I could ask any questions.\n\nAt the time, I thought it was hilarious. I thought they were gonna give me a parking ticket at first, but then I assumed these guys were bored and just decided to fuck with someone they saw who was obviously in a hurry. Everyone's got a guilty conscience, right?\n\nThe more I thought about it, though, the more worried I got. I'm a pretty law abiding guy; I smoke pot but I have a medical card, and there's nothing I can think of that I've done that could land me in trouble with the law. I also blatantly jaywalked across the street right in front of these guys, so if they really wanted to get up in my business they could've.\n\nBut what if there's some kind of an identity theft situation going on? What if I just look similar to someone who's been doing something shady? They drove right by my car, so they have my license plate number, and if they're associating it with someone who's committed or planning on committing a crime, that could be a problem for me.\n\nAny police officers have any idea what I should do, if anything?", "meta": {"score": 2, "top_level_comment": null, "retrieved_on": 1463444335, "gilded": 0, "gildings": null, "subreddit": "AskACop", "stickied": false, "permalink": "/r/AskACop/comments/48vb57/cops_pulled_up_and_told_me_weve_been_watching_you/", "author_flair_text": ""}}

The offending vehicle fled the scene, but witnesses called the police and identified the make and color of the vehicle, and provided a general description, but were not able to record a license plate. I filed a police report the following morning when i discovered the damage.  I recovered debris from the accident which confirmed the make of the offending vehicle, as well as additional pieces of the offending vehicle, which I have saved.\n\nOne week later, I spotted a car matching the exact description of the offending vehicle, with damage that matched the hit and run incident. This vehicle was parked on the same street on which the incident occured, parked one block down from where the incident occured.\n\nIs there any recourse for holding this individual responsible for the accident? I live in a major city, so I understand that this is not a priority by any means, I am just wondering what, if any, actions the police may be willing to take.\n\nI have called my local police district as well as my insurance company, since they have the most financial interest in the matter. I was brushed off by my police district over the phone, but am planning on going to the station tomorrow, primarily because I would just like to ensure that the information I have on the potentially-offending vehicle is documented. Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated.

Last night he spotted someone having problems getting into their car. Keys were in the ignition, doors locked, etc.\n\nHe helped them out, and as he normally does, asked for an ID and the registration to verify it's their car. The guy said he didn't have his ID, but had an Amex gift card with $100 left on it. He handed it to him, showed other cards in his wallet with the same name on them, drove off. Friend never got any information (mistake #1, didn't even get plates).\n\nMistake #2 was spending $100 on a TV at Wal-Mart (followed by dinner at a burger place, but this is a local burger place that's not going to have hundreds of cameras like a typical Wal-Mart).\n\nMistake #3 was not checking to see if it's an actual gift card. He called me today asking if I knew how to check the balance on an Amex gift card. I asked him which kind of Amex gift card. He said \"It just says American Express\". I know Amex gift cards don't say that, so I asked \"does it say 'A Gift For You', 'Gift Card', or anything like that where the name would be?\". He said no, and read off the name. I asked him what color the card was, he said gold.\n\nWell fuck.\n\nI googled the name. It's a unique enough name that the first hit turned up someone about a mile away from him. The name could be male or female depending on the spelling; the spelling is female, but the person he helped was a male. Making it better, this person is actually registered with the Texas BAR as a lawyer, and a legal columnist for a magazine.\n\nThe final piece: I looked up crime reports - there was one filed at her address 2 days ago, theft from a vehicle. So the card is hot. Super hot.\n\nHe's freaking out and has no idea what to do. I've thought about suggesting he contact the police department on the non-emergency number, or Amex, and being honest, and asking what to do - but I don't want to get him in any deeper shit than he already is (he's not the brightest person, as you can guess). He doesn't have the money to lawyer up (he's about to be evicted, and his family has cut him off because of his alcoholism). The TV is still sealed in the box.\n\nI'm sure if he tried to return the TV now, the return probably wouldn't go through, as the card has likely been reported stolen by now (and even if it does, that puts him in front of dozens more cameras). And Wal-Mart tracks the serial numbers of big ticket items like that, even a dinky 19\" TV.\n\nSuggestions?", "meta": {"score": 2, "top_level_comment": null, "retrieved_on": 1440914363, "gilded": 0, "gildings": null, "subreddit": "AskACop", "stickied": false, "permalink": "/r/AskACop/comments/2vhz5a/friend_is_a_locksmith_was_given_a_gift_card_by/", "author_flair_text": ""}}

The officer pulled me over and said that I rolled a stop sign and was going 14 miles over the speed limit and cited me for both violations. When he was handing me the ticket and explaining my options for the ticket however, he made a big point about how I had a clean driving record and was very courteous/cooperative. He then said that if I decide to dispute the ticket, he would consider dropping the ticket violation and consider dropping the points for the stop sign violation. He gave me a smile, shook my hand, and walked away.  It was clear to me at the time that he was nudging me to that option.\n\nI was initially so relieved that I didn't have time to think about what had just happened and ask questions about what would happen next. Now that it's over I'm wondering what happens if I do choose to dispute the ticket ...does that mean I have to go to court and deny the citations in court in front of the officer? If so, would the officer be offended that I would do that? As I think about it more, would the officer even remember that he said this to me when the time comes? He mentioned that he was patrolling the area specifically because of residential complains about drivers in the area, so I'm sure he will have ticketed a number of drivers (especially so since most drivers go around that speed in the area and roll that particular 3 way intersection).\n\nAny thoughts? Also any idea why the officer just didn't give me a warning or cite 1 violation on the ticket, if he was planning on cutting me a break?\n\nAppreciate any insights...Thanks everyone.\n\nEDIT: Also forgot to mention I am in CA and there is an option for trial by declaration.

I am currently in the police academy though and have many years of experience working with law enforcement as a police explorer and having many family members who are cops.\n\nThat disclaimer aside: This can vary by state. Typically a city police department is funded by the city government and patrols within the city limits and will assist officers/departments in surrounding cities if needed. \n\nSheriffs are typically (and I use typically for a reason) are funded by the county government and have jurisdiction over unincorporated areas within the county (land not belonging to a city government). They are also (usually) the higher law enforcement power in the county including within the jurisdiction of the cities within the county. (I know, this seems like a lot).\n\nThen you have either State Police or State Highway Patrol. Funded by the state government. Some states consider both to be the same thing, others like Ohio just have a Highway Patrol with no jurisdiction over anything other that highways and properties directly in correlation to the highways. Back when I lived in California (please any CHiPies correct me if I am wrong) the California Highway Patrol is not only just a state police division tasked with patrolling the highway but are also tasked with being the \"secret service\" if you will for the Governor of California. And they are also the highest form of law enforcement in the state. They set the standard for all law enforcement practices within California.\n\nNow in your case (depending on the city, county, state you live in) you may be like Los Angeles and its surrounding suburbs. A lot of the suburbs cannot afford to staff their own police department and therefore contract it out to the LAPD (Los Angeles Police Dept). Other areas further away from the Downtown part of LA do the same thing but with the Los Angeles County Sheriffs department. I lived in a city just outside of Los Angeles County and we had our own police dept, but the smaller city to the north east of mine had to contract out to the San Bernardino Couty Sheriffs Dept.\n\nSo it all really depends on what you see on the side of the cop cars in your area. Does it say the name of your city or something else? Do you see a lot of Sheriffs cars?\n\nWell I hope I answered that clearly enough. If not please let me know if there is anything I can clarify for you!

So I'm currently having a Facebook debate with a friend of mine over this whole Michael Brown situation. I've floated the idea that because the man was so large, regular escalation of force guidelines might not apply. He believes that the an officer is obligated to try non-lethal means no matter the size of the suspect. Setting aside what coulda, shoulda, and did or did not happen during that incident, it made me curious if a taser is as effective on a very large person as it would be on an average sized one. Also, any thoughts you escalation of force regarding super sized suspects would be appreciated. Thanks in advance, and stay safe out there.\n\nTasers are not always effective and not always able to be used. let me be clear for this next one. NO OFFICER IS OBLIGATED TO USE IT IN A DEADLY FORCE SITUATION. a person that is vastly larger then a cop is a deadly threat if charging them armed or not.\n\nas far as the effectiveness of the Taser it works on muscle mass, the spread of the Taser probes and a plethora of other factors. \n\nclothing can stop it, if the probes are too close its just pain not muscular interference, if the person has a lot of body fat that can stop it. bad placement can  render it useless, ect ect ect. the Taser is a great wonderful tool that has saved many people from getting hurt, police and suspects alike. but it is not a replacement for a gun and is not a deadly force tool. in my particular use of force its in between forceful talking and a baton. a asp baton is a harsher weapon as far as i am concerned, with much more capacity to cause harm.

What kind of training do cops actually have for dealing with people with mental illness? I understand that most cops experience with mental illness is from the guilty hoping that faking it will get them out of the situation, but are they actually trained to tell the difference between someone faking it and the real thing? Does that training only apply to someone whose mental illness actually makes them dangerous or does it also apply to someone like me who instinctively reacts to danger that probably isn't really there even when they know it's all in their head? \n\nAs for the experiences that taught me to not trust cops, I'll pm you with more details if you want, but strike 1 was when I tried reporting an assault and was told that I had willfully participated in my own torture. Strike 2 was a DARE officer who planted the drugs on every student he caught with drugs. All legitimate offenders who were actually caught in the act were caught by school staff or other students. I wonder how many legitimate offenders got away with it because they happened to be caught with drugs he planted on them rather than drugs they actually had. Strike 3 was being told that displaying symptoms of mental illness was grounds for being charged with disturbing the peace and/or disorderly conduct.

If you're not partaking in the devil's lettuce then explain to the cops that you are calling them every time because you don't want to get in trouble.  But definitely start a paper trail.
